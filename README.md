# website-tutorial
This is the companion github repository for my tutorial series on building and self-hosting your own website on a raspberry pi. Each release corresponds to a different lesson. I cover everything from how to create a barebones HTML website, to using flask as a backend server, to self hosting on raspberry pi with a WSGI and apache server.
